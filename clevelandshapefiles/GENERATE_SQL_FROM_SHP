Here's how to convert shape files to sql
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

First unzip the zip file in this folder::

    unzip cnp_shapefiles.zip

This should add a bunch of dbf, prj, shx, and shp files in your
directory.

There are two sets of files here, one with the filename
area_cdc_rev27jan2016_region.EXT and one lcaled clev_spa2010_region.EXT.

We'll generate both of these sets of files into requisite SQL insert
statements.

Run the following two commands::

    shp2pgsql -s 4326 area_cdc_rev27Jan2016_region.shp area_cdc postgres > area_cdc.sql

and::

     shp2pgsql -s 4326 clev_spa2010_region.shp clev_spa2010 postgres > clev_spa2010.sql


Then, when you open the sql files, you'll be able to find the insert
statments for the given areas. Use these how you will (either by
creating the tables the sql files will create, or by copying iand
pasting the parts you need into your own insert scripts).
