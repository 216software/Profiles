We want to add some data to a Geography
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Figure out what our Data Domains are (that )
----------------------------------------------------------------

We want to direct our attention to the following postgres tables::

    profiles_datadomain

This table should have been loaded with data from migrating the database
and loading the sample census data.

When we do a migrate, the column 'publish' is set to false. Pick the
ones we want to use and update the column 'publish' to true::

    update profiles_datadomain set publish = true;


Subdomains
----------

The db contains a link table to set up subdomains. It's called
'profiles_datadomain_subdomains' -- with a link to the top domain and
the domain below it. In this way, we can fill out on each page which
domains get displayed.

Now for the DATA
----------------

Now that we can see how domains work, it would be helpful if we could
actually view the data for a given domain and location.

Ok, important tables to know here -- Indicators (variables) are bound
up into groups.

So, make a new group for your variables
---------------------------------------

Insert into the table profiles_group::

    insert into profiles_group (name, order)
    values ('Test Population', 1);


profiles_group is references by profiles_datadomainindex, which means we
need to connect our group to our data domain.::

     insert into profiles_datadomainindex ("order", name, "dataDomain_id",
     group_id) values (1, 'Population Test', 13, 1);

This will be the header we see in the app for the set of data. Now we
need to attach indicators to the domain as well into the table
'profiles_indicatordomain' like this::

     insert into profiles_indicatordomain  (indicator_id, domain_id,
     "default") values (1, 1, true);
