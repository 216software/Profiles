Write docs
----------

Take what's in the wiki and put it into the docs folder
for new box set up -- currently setting up on local box
but we'll have to set up on amazon box as well, where
it might come in more handy...

NEXT
----

Get python manage.py syncdb to work correctly. Database peer
authentication fails

-  Figure out how to display data -- at the moment, no data is being
   displayed

   Where does the data come from -- how do we map it to geo records and
   get it to display???

-  With Matt, figure out what Mappings we'll need for the app
