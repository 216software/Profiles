Install PostGIS and dependencies
--------------------------------

This command should install PostgreSQL 9.3 with PostGIS 2.1 and related
dependencies::

    sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.3-postgis-2.1


Spatially enabling a database
-----------------------------


Connect to your database using pgAdminIII or psql, and use the commands
to add the PostgreSQL extensions. To add PostGIS with raster support::

    CREATE EXTENSION postgis;

To add topology support, a second extension can be created on the
database::

    CREATE EXTENSION postgis_topology;


Convert Shape file to sql file for imporation
---------------------------------------------

1. Find your shape file that you want to import -- a good source is
here:
https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/cbf/cbf_concity.html

Then use a utility called 'shp2pgsql' that should have been installed
with your postgres PostGIS installation.

Issue the following command to convert a shapefile into a sql files::
    shp2pgsql -s 4326 shapefile.shp shapefile postgres > shapefile.sql

Note -- the -s 4326 is a transformation, and should match what you have
your MultiPolygon column set up for in the psql database.

Also, you ll need your .shp file, your .shx file and your .dbf file all
together as well.
