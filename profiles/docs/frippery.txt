Frippery / Horsemeat
====================

*   Figure out if it is possible to reorganize logging in the yaml file
    so that it is more obvious how to just change the parts you want
    without having to copy over everything.

    Can handlers and formatters be defined elsewhere and then I just
    refer to them?

*   Break out webapp_session and user view models into separate files
    and store these in frippery so that other projects have this stuff.

*   Add a --rollback option to the upgrade-database script, so that it
    is super-easy to run stuff and check for errors.  Of course this
    won't catch all types of errors, but it will help.

*   Copy the emailtemplates directory and a contrived example into
    frippery.  Maybe something that shows how to reset password.

*   Add some notes to frippery to show how to use bower to check for
    updates and then update libraries.
