Consider re writing how temporary users works
---------------------------------------------

Right now we just ask for a name -- it might be useful if we
could create an actual person with a display name in our user
table -- call it a temporary user or something like that?

Email right now is non nullable, but we could allow it to
be null in this special case. That way we could still track
all photos back to the person table, with a display name,
but wouldn't necessarily be a logged in user.

Only those users that are actually logged in with a password
would then be able to do additional stuff? Something to think about...


Short Codes
-----------

Short code look up works meaning we can type in something like::

    test.profiles.local/rob-test

and we'll route correctly to the right album.

1. Make a way to create these short codes on album creation
   (or when editing the album later)

2. These cannot have numbers in them, so make sure when we do insert
   we do a check on handler list strings as well.

3. Some characters shouldn't be allowed like '/'

4. Test inserting and then routing.

5. Where should landing be? Maybe on upload page for that album?
