	<p style="float:left;width:440px;">The Providence Plan is an independent 501c3 nonprofit that provides Rhode Islanders and public agencies with data and information to support critical decision making. Our innovative programs improve community well-being and transform lives.
	</br></br>
	We believe that information – what exists, how it is used, and who uses it – is a fundamental
	aspect of community revitalization in an age of expanding information technology.

	<p>
	We work to democratize information by transforming data from spreadsheets and complex databases into maps, charts, and interactive tools that empower policymakers and residents to advocate for community change.
	</br></br>
	Our data warehouse, the largest of its kind in Rhode Island, is compiled from federal, state, and local statistics. By bringing together data from multiple sources, our tools provide a comprehensive snapshot of communities that would otherwise be unavailable.
	</br></br>
	Over the next several years we look forward to leveraging new technologies that will allow us to present greater amounts of information more quickly - and in increasingly interactive formats. We also remain fundamentally committed to expanding the work of our programs and seeding new initiatives that are consistent with our mission.
