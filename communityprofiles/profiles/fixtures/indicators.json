            "limitations": "The most general limitation for many decades has been the tendency of people to overreport ages or years of birth that end in zero or five. This phenomenon is called \"age heaping.\"   \r\n\r\nThere is some tendency for respondents to provide their age as of the date they completed the census questionnaire or interview, not their age as of the census reference date (April 1). In Census 2010, the question was expanded to two parts (i.e., age and date of birth). Both age and date of birth responses are used in combination to determine the most accurate age for the person as of the census reference date. The modified question along with editing procedures have attempted to minimize the effect of this reporting problem on tabulations. Additionally, the 2010 age question displays the census reference date prominently, and interviewer training emphasizes the importance of collecting age as of the reference date.\r\n\r\nRespondents sometimes round a persons age up if they were close to having a birthday. For most single years of age, the misstatements are largely offsetting. The problem is most pronounced at age 0. There is some respondent resistance to reporting age as 0 years. (Age in completed months was not collected for infants under age 1.) Editing procedures correct this problem.\r\n\r\nFor more details see the [Technical Documentation](http://www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/decennial/index.html) on Summary File 1 for Census 2000 and Census 2010.
