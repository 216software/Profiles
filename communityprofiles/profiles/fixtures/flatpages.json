We hope to empower the government, businesses, nonprofits, institutes of higher education, and residents to use this information to identify local needs, prioritize investments, and advocate for community change. \r\n\r\nRhode Island Community Profiles was created and is maintained by The Providence Plan. Funding for the project comes from the Rhode Island Foundation and the Rhode Island Statewide Planning Program.\r\n###Data Sources\r\n\r\nData on this site comes from the US Census Bureau as well as data made accessible through the RI Department of Health, RI Department of Education, and the RI Department of Children, Youth, and Families. We are actively pursuing new data partnerships and will add additional datasets as they become available. If you are a community partner and you are unable to find the data you are looking for, please contact us: jlucht@provplan.org.\r\n\r\n###Open Source Development\r\nThis site is an open-source project. The code, design, and structure for the site will soon be publically available, free of charge. We look forward to sharing the template we have developed with other organizations across the country that are interested in helping democratize data on behalf of their communities.\r\n\r\n###Future Improvements\r\nWe are hard at work developing a variety of new features including:\r\n\r\n- A \u201cMy Shelf\u201d feature that will allow users to save and organize their maps, charts, and graphs.\r\n- A \u201ccreate your own neighborhood\u201d feature that will allow users to create and save a unique geographic area of interest and display data for that area. \r\n- Neighborhood-level data for communities with traditionally established neighborhoods (e.g. Providence, Pawtucket, Cranston, Woonsocket, and East Providence).\r\n", "enable_comments": false}}, {"pk": 4, "model": "flatpages.flatpage", "fields": {"registration_required": false, "title": "Contact Us", "url": "/about/contact/", "template_name": "flatpages/contact.html", "sites": [1, 2], "content": "Feedback and General Questions:\r\n\r\n401.455.8880\r\ninfo@provplan.org\r\n\r\nRequests for Access to Data:\r\n\r\nJim Lucht\r\n401.455.8880 x215\r\njlucht@provplan.org\r\n\r\nPress Contact:\r\n\r\nTaylor Ellowitz\r\n401.455.8880 x216\r\ntellowitz@provplan.org\r\n\r\nFor Updates on Our Work:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"#\">Subscribe to our Enews!</a>\r\n<a href=\"#\">Like us on Facebook!</a>\r\n<a href=\"#\">Follow us on Twitter!</a>\r\n\r\n", "enable_comments": false}}, {"pk": 2, "model": "flatpages.flatpage", "fields": {"registration_required": false, "title": "About the Data", "url": "/about/data/", "template_name": "flatpages/default.html", "sites": [1, 2], "content": "#Data Sources\r\nData on this site comes from the US Census Bureau, the RI Department of Health and eventually the RI Department of Education.

The bulk of this information is contained in Census Summary File 1 (SF1) or Short Form. Through the 2000 Census the bureau also collected Summary File 3 (SF3) or Long Form data. In addition to collecting basic demographic information, it asked around 50 additional questions about socio-economic and housing characteristics.  In 2000 it was sent to about one 1 out of 6 households.  \r\n\r\nAfter the 2000 Census, the US Census Bureau discontinued SF3 and replaced it with the American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS is a random survey of the population conducted continuously throughout the year.  A random sample is surveyed each year so multiple years of data are combined to try to account for the true population of all areas.  Many of the questions asked by SF3 are now available on the ACS, but not all. Additionally, due to a smaller sample size, some data are unavailable at finer levels of geography.  \r\n\r\nThe ACS is available for 3 different time categories that represent different levels of geography: 1\u2010year (areas above 65k population), 3\u2010year (areas above 20k population), and 5\u2010year (tract and block group). The 5\u2010year ACS estimates are the data that replicate SF3; census tract and (some) block group level data are available, but margins of error are wide and we have chosen only to display tract-level data in the Community Profiles.\r\n\r\nThe 2006\u20102010 5\u2010year survey data is keyed to the 2010 short-form census results. It is appropriate to compare SF3 and ACS 5\u2010year data for many but not all variables. See the Margin of Error section below for a description of sampling error for the ACS.\r\n\r\n#CHANGES IN GEOGRAPHIES\r\nCensus geographies are updated every decade to account for population shifts and growth. State\u2010wide geography does not change. Municipalities generally should not shift in geography but there are few cases where blocks are attributed to different RI municipalities between 2000 and 2010 (Example: a few Providence blocks were attributed to Johnston).\r\n\r\nCensus tracts have the most change. They can be added, removed, split, or consolidated (roughly based on a population target of 4,000). Within tracts, block groups and blocks can also be added, removed, split or consolidated. Documentation of all changes is available on the Census TIGER website. http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/\r\n\r\nChanges to geographies make comparisons difficult across datasets and years. For SF1 data, ProvPlan created a statewide 2000 block to 2010 tract crosswalk that works in the background to allow users to see 2000 count data as\u20182010\u2019 tracts to be able to compare data over time. SF3/ACS was more challenging, particularly for medians and averages that are tricky to impute or interpolate. We overcame this by using 2000 block groups to constitute 2010 tracts where the tract had changed (only five tracts in the State). In the even rarer case where 2000 block groups did not fit within 2010 tract boundaries, we used underlying block values to split the variable proportionally between the two 2010 tracts.\r\n\r\nMARGIN OF ERROR \r\nAs indicated above, the American Community Survey is a continuous sampling of population and households throughout the year. The data are sample estimates and are subject to sampling error. Margins of Error are provided for each estimate at each geography level and should always be checked before drawing conclusions. Depending on the level of geography the estimates may have a margin of error too wide to show any meaningful change over time.\r\n\r\nTo overcome wide margins of error ACS users have a few options. They can sum across table categories to create new groups (ex: age 0\u20105 instead of age 0, 1,2,3,4,5 alone), sum up several tracts to create a new geography level (ex: add several tracts together to get a neighborhood), or do a combination of the two.  Users have to create new estimates and new margins of error when summing up categories or across geographies. Documentation of necessary formulas is provided by Census in ACS handbooks. <link to handbooks>\r\nThe Community Profiles deals with MOE in several ways. First we recalculate MOE automatically for any of our indicators that require a combination of multiple fields. This is very convenient for the user because our published indicators are based on popular demand and help overcome the fact that the Census is very fine-grained and users inevitably combine fields to get what they want. Secondly we provide margin of error in all of our ACS tabular output. A user can easily see whether the MOE is larger than a change figure. Lastly we provide error bars on our Map & Ranking graphics. Although we do provide interactive mapping without indication of MOE, our hope is that users will get more mileage out of the Map & Ranking because it is a more powerful data display for analysis.\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\nAdditional information on Census Data is available here.  http://provplan.org/assets/uploads/fom/CensusResourceSheets.pdf\r\n\r\nCensus 2010 Block-level Data with Common SF1 Variables is available from our partners at the Rhode Island Geographic Information System here. http://www.edc.uri.edu/rigis/data/data.aspx?ISO=society\r\n", "enable_comments": false}}, {"pk": 5, "model": "flatpages.flatpage", "fields": {"registration_required": false, "title": "Frequently Asked Questions", "url": "/about/faq/", "template_name": "flatpages/faq.html", "sites": [1, 2], "content": "", "enable_comments": false}}, {"pk": 3, "model": "flatpages.flatpage", "fields": {"registration_required": false, "title": "About ProvPlan", "url": "/about/provplan/", "template_name": "flatpages/provplan.html", "sites": [1, 2], "content": "The Providence Plan is an independent 501c3 nonprofit that provides Rhode Islanders and public agencies with data and information to support critical decision making.
