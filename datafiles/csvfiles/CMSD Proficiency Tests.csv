"Note 1: In order to avoid possible disclosure of any confidential information, counts and rates are suppressed when the number of students who took the test is less than 10.  The code  '999999' is used to show suppression."

"Note 2: In the 2014-15 School Year, Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC) tests replaced the Ohio Achievement Assessments (OAA).  PARCC testing will not be continued. It will be replaced by American Institutes of Research (AIR) tests in the 2015-16 school year.  Since PARCC passage rates cannot be compared with OAA passsage rates in the previous years and the AIR passage rates in the forthcoming years; thus only OGT numbers and rates are updated this year."
